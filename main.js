/* 
alien language translator

There are aliens that have contacted us, and they have tried to use English, but it has gone a bit wrong!

The good news is that the alien's attempt is really similar to English, but all the letters they use are 5 letters after the real words in the alphabet. So, for example, the word "hello" would be "mjqqt".

write a function that takes a string and returns the alien translation!

function alienTranslator(string) {
    
}
