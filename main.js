alien language translator

There are aliens that have contacted us, and they have tried to use English, but it has gone a bit wrong!

The good news is that the alien's attempt is really similar to English, but all the letters they use are 5 letters after the real letters in the alphabet. So, for example, the word "hello" would be "mjqqt". (The 5th letter after "h" is "m" , the 5th letter after "e" is "j", etc.)

Any letter at the end of the alphabet will wrap around to the beginning, so "z" would be "e".

write a function that takes an alien string and returns the English translation!
(you will only get a string with lowercase letters and spaces).

//ðŸ‘‰ Write the function your CodeWarriors will start with below here:
export function alienTranslator(string) {
    //your code here - good luck! Or rather "ltti qzhp!"
}
